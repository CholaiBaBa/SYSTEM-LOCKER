# Syestem-Locker


 Only works on Termux !
 If you stuck on "Authentication Required !". Check:

 Both termux and termux-api are downloaded from playstore.
 Do not download from other sites
 like apkmirror.com or if you have f-droid then download
 from there. But remember download both from same source.

 If still not working then it could be your device issue.
 check your android version is 6.0+.
